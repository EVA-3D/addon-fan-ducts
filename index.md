# Custom Fan Ducts

This addon is all about custom layer cooling that your setup may require.

If you have a fan duct you'd like contribute to EVA please let us know.

## Volcano

The Horns Duct v2 variant for E3D Volcano. It takes the standard EVA air output from the back and directs it to the tip of a Volcano nozzle which is considerably lower than it is with other hotends.

In 1.3.0 a [MK3 RHD Fan Duct Rev. C](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3249344) remix was added, it does not have a Volcano variant but is narrower than Horns Duct which maybe important for an IDEX assembly
